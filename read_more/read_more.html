            <h1>
                App Icon Redesign
            </h1>

            <p>
                So, for my first ever assessment for my design module in Semester 1 of my Year 1, 
                I was assigned to go and look for any existing app and 
                redesign its app icon! I thought that this would be a pretty fun 
                and exciting assessment as now I've got the opportunity to create a 
                new design that I can call my own.
            </p>

            <h3>
                App to be re-designed
            </h3>

            <p>
                After a deciding between a few apps, I settled on redesigning my school's own app for 
                students called mStudent which is also called NPal. 
                I decided to redesign this app because of its outdated and aged design. 
                I thought that the current app design was a little unattractive and not 
                very attention grabbing due to its common aesthetic. It also has unecessary 
                details in the background which is hard to see due to it being a app icon.
            </p>

            <h3>
                The Design Process
            </h3>

            <p>
                Once I was able to identify what were the problems with the current design, 
                I set out to first start coming up with ideas that tackle these problems. 
                The picture below was my first few sketches where I just 
                drew anything that came to mind. <br><br>

                I then started workigng on the graphic designs in Photoshop 
                and also made sure to gather feedback from my Design Module 
                lecturer and also other friends whom are designers themselves. 
                Here below is how my designs progressed over the next few weeks!
                <br><br>

                At first, I thought that i'd go for a 3D graphic design, however 
                I decided to go for a flat design instead as I realised the 3D 
                effect was hard to notice when it is used as a icon due to its 
                small size. I then changed the background colour to a gradient 
                that matches my school's colours (which was inspired by NP's IG 
                colours). After getting more feedback on the design, I added 
                outlines to further help seperate the NPal logo itself from the 
                background! 
            </p>

            <h3>
                Design Rationale
            </h3>

            <p>
                I decided on this pink-blue colour scheme as it matched our 
                school's IG colour scheme and I increased its saturation to 
                make it more attractive and attention grabbing. Overall, I 
                adopted a more modern and appealing design by simplifying the 
                overall look, now instead of having a crowded background it has 
                a simple gradient background which despite its simplicity, 
                I feel that it is still able to get the user's attention. 
                The app icon now is also more straight forward and clear with 
                its function, that it is the NPal app for students and due to 
                its unique, bright colour scheme, it tends to stand out in a 
                sea of applications in the student's phone.
            </p>

            <h3>
                Reflections
            </h3>

            <p>
                Overall, I felt like this was really an eye-opening experience 
                in terms of getting me to think like a designer and not just 
                design things to look nice, but also to design things that are 
                useful and not cause more troubles or issues for the user. 
                I really enjoyed myself as I had to learn more on Photoshop 
                techniques and had to learn how to stick to a design process 
                to help me come up with such ideas. I'm currently already assigned 
                Assessment 2 which is to create a app splashpage for the app we 
                chose to redesign and I do hope that through my experience in 
                designing for Assessment 1, I hope to streamline my own design 
                process and hope to come up with more useful and creative ideas!
