# Portofolio Website Coding

#### Hi! My name's Phil and this github repo will be where I'll be storing my HTML and CSS code for my Portofolio website!

#### Website is now up and running [here!](https://philkwek.github.io/ID_portfolio_assignment/) (Note: Website hosted on github is broken, please download files and view using Live Server on an IDE to view full site)

## Design Process 

I first started off with listing the qualities that I would want my portfolio website to have and down below are some of it.

* A Clean, Simple Layout.
* User Friendly and Easy to Navigate.
* Clear about its Purpose.

Next, with these qualities in mind, I went ahead to start creating the wireframe in Adobe XD, taking into account 2 different screen sizes so that my website would also support both desktop and mobile users. Here is the link to download my [wireframes!](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1oCgn3ezm6XsA9T6pV9cr2eVRY9IlXknG?usp=sharing)


## Features left to implement
