# Portofolio Website Coding

#### Hi! My name's Phil and this github repo will be where I'll be storing my HTML and CSS code for my Portofolio website!

## Design Process 

I first started off with listing the qualities that I would want my portfolio website to have and down below are some of it.

* A Clean, Simple Layout.
* User Friendly and Easy to Navigate.
* Clear about its Purpose.

Next, with these qualities in mind, I went ahead to start creating the wireframe in Adobe XD, taking into account 2 different screen sizes so that my website would also support both desktop and mobile users. Here is the link to a pdf of my [wireframes!](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qAvcI0huEjRLnB29Tk3FDEIk5zcOyG8M/view?usp=sharing)
